#This project will aim to simulate my Dog (Gubbie) in terms of his blood glucose curve and allow someone to probe the curve in order to determine the next action to take with regards to giving an insulin dose.

I plan to expand it over time to cope with more varied scenarios. It will also be used as my learning project for Python and development methods etc.
